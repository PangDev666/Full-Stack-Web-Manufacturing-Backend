## Website Manufacturing | Development - Backend
I have built a full-stack website for a factory, featuring both a frontend and backend. It is intended for customers or anyone interested in the products to visit and explore. This is just a part of the website and not the complete version.

I started by using Figma for the initial design to ensure it met the expectations of the project owner. I used Photoshop to edit images and set the tone of the website. Then, I began developing the website with VS Code using Next.js, and I used MongoDB to store all the data.
